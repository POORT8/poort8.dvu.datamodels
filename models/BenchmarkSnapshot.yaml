          This entity contains a harmonised description of a BenchmarkSnapshot. This entity is used to store the snapshot of an energy usage benchmark made through DVU. Each benchmark is associated with a 'Verblijfsobject' as defined by the BAG, and holds information about the following:
          - Gross energy usage per m2
          - Adjusted gross energy usage per m2 (optional), if BAG correction is pending
          - Nett energy usage (optional), based on user adjustments by the WEii-protocol.
